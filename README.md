## You may clone this repository to download the app:
If it is not already installed, you will need to install inquirer using the npm install command in order for the app to work properly.

## Use:
1. Make sure you are in the correct directory, then run the app by typing "node play" in the terminal.
2. You will be shown a word or phrase with the letters replaced by underscores and prompted to enter a letter to guess.
3. If you guess correctly, you will be prompted to make another guess.
4. If you guess incorrectly you will be told how many guesses remain and, if you still have guesses, you will be prompted to guess again.
5. When you have either guessed the word correctly or run out of guesses you will be prompted to choose to play again or exit the application.
